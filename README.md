# Peace

Peace is a Mood diary &amp; gym for your thoughts. It was made as a project for the [Hamburg Geekettes HackathonHH 2015](http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon).

##Context

Currently 350 Mio. people worldwide have a depression.
 
For treatment, most patients work with psychologist need medicine and close attention, but in many cases the attention part is easier said than done. 

The type and dose of medicin needs to be adjusted to everyone individually. Its fit is measured through your change in mood, sleeping and eating habits, etc. Those also need to be monitored by your psychologists to know about the current state of your depression. 

We consider that Mental health is still taboo or not seriously covered of by app makers.

##Our work

We designed a mood tracking application prototype. We named it **Peace**. It lets you input and track your mood over time, provides tools to cheer you up, reach a safe space, or report an emergency. 

We believe we can help millions of users, specially when using it parallelly to professional counseling.

##Take the app for a ride

If you want to participate and test the app prototype, you can do it by:

## Future
We would like to make this a useful, running app that you can work natively with. For this we are considering applying for some funding and professional help from psychologysts to make it a fully functional piece of work.
