# Peace

Peace is a Mood diary &amp; gym for your thoughts. It was made as a project for the [Hamburg Geekettes HackathonHH 2015](http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon). It runs as a web app, so you can pretty much open it in almost any device with an internet connection (display quality may vary). **Right now is mostly a mockup, but if you join this piece by forking it, we could make it a fully functional app.**

##Context

[**Currently 350 Mio. people worldwide have depression.**](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/)
 
For treatment, most patients work with psychologist need medicine and close attention, but in many cases the attention part is easier said than done. The type and dose of medicine needs to be adjusted to everyone individually. Its fit is measured through an approximated expectation of changes in mood, sleeping and eating habits, etc. Patients in many cases also need to be monitored by psychologists to know about the current state of their condition depression. 

We consider that [Mental health is still taboo or not seriously covered of by app makers](https://github.com/svenport/peace/blob/master/screengrabs/mental%20health%20app%20mess.jpg). So we decided to assess that during our hackathon project. We wanted to make something pretty, empathetic, useful, and simple that can help anyone with a phone and an internet connection.

##Our work

We designed a mood tracking application prototype. We named it **Peace**. It lets you input and track your mood over time, provides tools to cheer you up, reach a safe space, or report an emergency. 

We believe we can help millions of users, specially when using it parallelly to professional counseling.

##Take the app for a ride

If you want to participate and test the app prototype, you can do it by:

1. Open [this link](http://svenport.de/peace/peace.php) in your mobile browser
2. Add it to your home screen as an app

3. Tap it and and play with it.

## Future
We would like to make this a useful, running app that you can work natively with. For this we are considering applying for some funding and professional help from psychologysts to make it a fully functional piece of work.

## Risks
This has been worked by a group of passionate people that, while aiming for empathy, are not psychology professionals. Hence this app, as it is today (May 25th, 2015) might have underlying risks. We want to have an empowering tool based on empathy and real need. Please fork, comment, or pass this repository to your friends. The more people involved, the better.
