# Peace

Peace is a Mood diary &amp; gym for your thoughts. It was made as a project for the [Hamburg Geekettes HackathonHH 2015](http://hamburg-hackathon.de/hackathon).

##Context

Currently 350 Mio. people worldwide have a depression.
 soon depression will be the second most common disease
 
For treatment - most patients work with psychologist and get medicin. The type and dose of medicin needs to be adjusted to everyone individually. Its fit is measured through your change in mood, sleeping and eating habits, etc. Those also need to be monitored by your psychologists to know about the current state of your depression. 

##Our work
 
We designed a mood tracking application. We named it Peace. It lets you input and track your mood over time, provides tools to cheer you up, reach a safe space, or report a mental illness related emergency. 

We believe we can help millions of users, specially when using it parallelly to professional (medical?) counseling. 

##Take the app for a ride

If you want to participate and test the app prototype, you can do it by: 

1. Opening this link in your mobile browser, 
2. Add it to your home screen as an app 
3. Tap it and and play with it.

## Future
We would like to make this a useful, running app that you can work natively with. For this we are considering applying for some funding and professional help from psychologysts to make it a fully functional piece of work.
